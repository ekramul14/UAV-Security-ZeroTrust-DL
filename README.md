# Enhancing UAV Security Through Zero Trust Architecture: An Advanced Deep Learning and Explainable AI Analysis

# Overview
This repository contains the code and research paper for the work titled "Enhancing UAV Security Through Zero Trust Architecture: An Advanced Deep Learning and Explainable AI Analysis." The project aims to address the growing security challenges posed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by implementing a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) enhanced with advanced Deep Learning (DL) techniques and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

# Abstract
The dynamic and rapidly evolving field of UAVs necessitates robust and transparent security measures. This study emphasizes the importance of implementing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to enhance UAV security, moving away from traditional perimeter defenses. The proposed approach achieves an 84.59% accuracy in detecting and identifying UAVs using Radio Frequency (RF) signals within a Deep Learning framework. Additionally, the integration of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) tools ensures the model's transparency and interpretability, making the classifications verifiable and comprehensible.
